            <p>On January 26th and 27th I participated in a hackathon sponsored
              by Beyond on behalf of the Henry Street Settlement. Representatives
              from the Henry Street Settlement arrived with multiple challenges
              they addressed on a regular basis they felt could be mitigated through
              the strategic use of technology.
            </p>
            <p>My team’s prompt was to design an app for the participants in the
              Lower East Side Youth Opportunity Hub, an outreach program for at-risk
              youth to help them find stable employment, educational opportunities,
              recreational activities, and other support. The goal of this app was
              both to enable youth participants find events and outreach programs
              relevant to them and to help the organizations putting together those
              programs keep track of their participants. We broke this goal down
              into the following objectives for the final product:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
              <ol>
                <li>Accessible via smartphone (app)</li>
                <li>Ease of use (familiar UI settings)</li>
                <li>Technically scalable and easy to maintain</li>
                <li>Enables timely distribution of information</li>
                <li>Collects user information (demographics and statistics)</li>
                <li>Aesthetically reminiscent of a rec center to escape the stigma
                  of social work or charity</li>
              </ol>
            </blockquote>
            <p>We ultimately designed two separate but connected apps. One for
              the youth involved in the program (Clients), and one was for the
              employees of the partner organizations (Organizers). The Organizers
              app would give them access to the views and experiences of the Client
              app, but would also allow them a separate space to keep track of the
              data from their various events and youth clients.
            </p>
            <p><strong>My Contribution: </strong>I was an active participant in
              all the stakeholder interviews, user persona development, user flow
              prioritization, and wireframe development. Our group split up to
              develop the high-fidelity mockups, and my particular contribution
              here was designing the event details page for the web app.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Results: </strong>Our team came in second out of all the
              participating teams in the Hackathon. We were particularly singled
              out for scaling our technological solution to the resources of Henry
              Street, while still being mindful of the needs of both sets of users.
              Our team also sent our final presentation, and all our deliverables
              to the representatives at Henry Street, in the hopes that they will
              find them actionable, and have made ourselves available to assist
              in anyway.</p>

              <h4>Background on the Hackathon and my team:</h4>
              <p>The Hackathon was held by Beyond for the benefit of Henry Street Settlement,
                a New York-based nonprofit that delivers a wide range of social
                services, arts, and healthcare programs for more than 60,000 people
                each year. Henry Street focused their outreach on New York’s Lower
                East Side.
              </p>
              <p>At the event, Henry Street gave participants a choice from eight
                different problems the organization was encountering that they felt
                could be addressed through strategic application of technology.
                The solutions presented by hackathon participants were going to
                be judged on the following criteria:
             </p>
             <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">

             <p>My group ultimately chose to work on the Youth Opportunity Hub, an

                  are an initiative sponsored by the Manhattan District Attorney’s
                  Office of Criminal Justice initiative. They are programs designed
                  to provide “one-stop” support for at risk youth (ages 13 - 24)
                  who are believed to be at risk of becoming involved in the
                  criminal justice system.
                </p>
                <p>The Henry Street Settlement partnered with five other organizations
                  to launch a <a href="https://www.henrystreet.org/programs/youth/youth-opportunity-hub/" class="underline">

                  Planning Council, Educational Alliance, Grand Street Settlement,
                  Hamilton-Madison House, and University Settlement). Together,

                <p>With this context, we were ready to find out about the specific

              <h4>Stakeholder Interview</h4>
              <p>Our first order of business was to interview Matt Phifer, a
                Deputy Program Officer of Education and Employment at Henry
                Street, who was able to give us more detailed context on the
                specific struggles the organization was having with the Youth Hub.
              </p>
              <p>Matt was incredibly generous with his time, and took us into
                great detail about the struggles his organization was having
                tracking the success of the Hub. From this conversation we
                identified some critical pain points:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
                <ul>
                  <li><p><strong>Inability to track and manage event attendees: </strong>
                    The Youth Hub is being sponsored by multiple organizations
                    who held responsibility for different types of events or
                    resources. This made it hard for them to track a Client’s
                    experience across the Hub. For instance, if a client met with
                    a social worker who recommended they go to a resume workshop,
                    it was hard for that social worker to know if they ended up
                    attending it. It was also difficult for organizations to
                    recognize if a Client was new to the Hub or returning. To
                    illustrate this, we learned that although Matt knew that 112
                    Clients had participated in Youth Hub events, only 40 had open
                    cases.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><p><strong>Difficulty in identifying trends and areas of interest:
                  </strong>Organizers might not know until the moment an event is
                  happening how many people are coming or interested. Being able
                  to see RSVPs on an app would help them know which events attract
                  more interest ahead of time. Moreover, by using a ticketing
                  system on the app they would not have to worry about manually
                  signing in attendees and following up with them later, but would
                  have all their information in one place already.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><p><strong>Challenges in getting youths interested and retaining
                    interest in Henry Street and partner events and activities:</strong>
                    This highlights a problem that is not unique to Henry Street--it’s
                    hard for institutions to reach out to young people in a way that
                    seems authentic and interesting. Matt thought an App would help
                    potential clients keep track of Youth Hub events using resources
                    they are already comfortable with (i.e. a cell phone).</p>

              <p>A solution to these problems had to both make it easy and rewarding
                for Youth Hub participants to engage with the Hub using resources
                they already had available (i.e. a smartphone) and make it easy for
                social workers, program coordinators, and stakeholders in each of
                the organizations sponsoring the event to track information. With
                this information, we outlined our objectives:

                <h4>User Stories</h4>
                <p>We knew we were designing for two users: the youth participants
                  in the program, and the representatives of the organization
                  managing the program. Accordingly, we developed two personas
                  that could be representative of these groups:

                <p class="caption">Our two users stories.
                </p>
                <p>We chose age 18 for Ron because it was a threshold age that
                  would make him conceivably accessible for programs aged at young
                  adults (career development) and teenagers (e.g. education). We
                  also opted to make him partially homeless as Matt had highlighted
                  housing insecurity as being a frequent issue for youth in the
                  program, which made things like asking for an address difficult
                  and potentially fraught for users who were being onboarded.

                <p>Chelsea was representative of all the employees of the
                  organizations involved in sponsoring the Youth Hub. We chose to
                  make her a social worker as Matt had highlighted them as being
                  hands on and mobile in their work and outreach, and also primary
                  points-of-contact for youth in the programs.

                    identified points where they could be enabled by technology.

                  <p>As we were working with a limited timeframe, we prioritized

                  <p>Ultimately, we decided to do hi-fi prototypes of the login
                    page, the Client home page, the Client profile page, an event
                    details page, and a visualization of the main landing page for

                    <p>We also used the format of this brochure to inform some of
                      our aesthetic decisions within the app. Most notably, the
                      hexagon shape of the brochure designed to underscore a “hive”
                      motif in the marketing--we utilized this hexagon in the profile
                      images of the app later.

                    <p>Our team had multiple UX Designers, so after agreeing to
                      a color palette and font structure we were able to breakout
                      separately to design the high fidelity mockups.

                    <h4>High Fidelity Mockups</h4>
                    <p>My individual contribution to the high-fidelity mockups was
                      designing the event details page. I knew Matt wanted his youth
                      users to utilize this app the way they would Facebook or any
                      other app, so from the beginning it was incredibly important
                      to me that this page be laid out in a way that was familiar
                      for its users.
                    </p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I conducted a very quick benchmark of the event
                      details page on a Facebook event, a Meetup event, and an Eventbrite.

                      their pages, we decided as a group that the ticket scanning
                      function should go on the event detail page instead of the
                      user’s profile page. This would help users who RSVPed to
                      multiple events keep track of their tickets. This feature
                      is incredibly important to the app, as it would allow social
                      workers like Chelsea to more easily keep track of who attended
                      events.

            <h4>Stakeholder Research was Crucial</h4>
            <p>I was incredibly proud of the work our team did in a short amount
              of time. The fact that we spent so much of our upfront time talking
              to Matt and planning out our approach helped us be much surer of our
              decisions later on. The biggest benefit of this planning time was that
              it made us mindful to be realistic about our solution; we did not want
              to design something so convoluted it ended up being a time sink for
              Henry Street. Matt and his colleagues had already told us that across
              the organization they were responsible for maintaining over 30 databases,
              all responsible for tracking different pieces of information for different
              government entities and grants. We did not want maintaining this
              app to turn into one more data-set employees had to fill out when
              they could be spending time with clients who needed them.</p>
            <p>Our two app solution, we hoped, would help automate things employees
              spent time doing manually. A quick scan of a users ticket could help
              keep track who actually came to events, and having some information
              about that youth participant already on hand would make it easier
              to reference it quickly.
            </p>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>A major challenge our team faced was that we had four User Experience
              Designers, 2 Product/Project Managers, and only two developers. While
              the UX Designers were able to quickly put together wireframes and
              mockups to present to the judges, our developers did not have the
              equivalent firepower to put together an initial prototype of the
              apps. While they got further than we expected, and definitely laid
              a solid foundation, our presentation relied more heavily on the mockups
              to convey our ideas.

            <h4>Overall</h4>
            <p>So many design challenges revolve around helping companies on the
              cutting-edge of technology, so it was surprisingly difficult to go
              back to the basics and think about what resources people who don’t
              actually work in technology need to make their lives easier. During
              the early ideation phase we tossed around a lot of ideas for more
              sophisticated databases, detailed user profiles, two native apps,
              but quickly realized that many of those had the potential to become
              a burden instead of a tool. Our two app proposal was not the most
              elegantly delivered solution, but it was developed with a realistic
              understanding of what would actually be helpful to our stakeholders,
              which ultimately helped us stand apart from the group.</p>
