            <p>On January 26th and 27th I participated in a hackathon sponsored
              by Beyond on behalf of the Henry Street Settlement. Representatives
              from the Henry Street Settlement arrived with multiple challenges
              they addressed on a regular basis they felt could be mitigated through
              the strategic use of technology.
            </p>
            <p>My team’s prompt was to design an app for the participants in the
              Lower East Side Youth Opportunity Hub, an outreach program for at-risk
              youth to help them find stable employment, educational opportunities,
              recreational activities, and other support. The goal of this app was
              both to enable youth participants find events and outreach programs
              relevant to them and to help the organizations putting together those
              programs keep track of their participants. We broke this goal down
              into the following objectives for the final product:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
              <ol>
                <li>Accessible via smartphone (app)</li>
                <li>Ease of use (familiar UI settings)</li>
                <li>Technically scalable and easy to maintain</li>
                <li>Enables timely distribution of information</li>
                <li>Collects user information (demographics and statistics)</li>
                <li>Aesthetically reminiscent of a rec center to escape the stigma
                  of social work or charity</li>
              </ol>
            </blockquote>
            <p>We ultimately designed two separate but connected apps. One for
              the youth involved in the program (Clients), and one was for the
              employees of the partner organizations (Organizers). The Organizers
              app would give them access to the views and experiences of the Client
              app, but would also allow them a separate space to keep track of the
              data from their various events and youth clients.
            </p>
            <p><strong>My Contribution: </strong>I was an active participant in
              all the stakeholder interviews, user persona development, user flow
              prioritization, and wireframe development. Our group split up to
              develop the high-fidelity mockups, and my particular contribution
              here was designing the event details page for the web app.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Results: </strong>Our team came in second out of all the
              participating teams in the Hackathon. We were particularly singled
              out for scaling our technological solution to the resources of Henry
              Street, while still being mindful of the needs of both sets of users.
              Our team also sent our final presentation, and all our deliverables
              to the representatives at Henry Street, in the hopes that they will
              find them actionable, and have made ourselves available to assist
              in anyway.</p>

              <h4>Background on the Hackathon and my team:</h4>
              <p>The Hackathon was held by Beyond for the benefit of Henry Street Settlement,
                a New York-based nonprofit that delivers a wide range of social
                services, arts, and healthcare programs for more than 60,000 people
                each year. Henry Street focused their outreach on New York’s Lower
                East Side.
              </p>
              <p>At the event, Henry Street gave participants a choice from eight
                different problems the organization was encountering that they felt
                could be addressed through strategic application of technology.
                The solutions presented by hackathon participants were going to
                be judged on the following criteria:
             </p>
             <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">

             <p>My group ultimately chose to work on the Youth Opportunity Hub, an

                  are an initiative sponsored by the Manhattan District Attorney’s
                  Office of Criminal Justice initiative. They are programs designed
                  to provide “one-stop” support for at risk youth (ages 13 - 24)
                  who are believed to be at risk of becoming involved in the
                  criminal justice system.

                <p>The Henry Street Settlement partnered with five other organizations

                  Planning Council, Educational Alliance, Grand Street Settlement,
                  Hamilton-Madison House, and University Settlement). Together,

                <p>With this context, we were ready to find out about the specific

              <h4>Stakeholder Interview</h4>
              <p>Our first order of business was to interview Matt Phifer, a
                Deputy Program Officer of Education and Employment at Henry
                Street, who was able to give us more detailed context on the
                specific struggles the organization was having with the Youth Hub.
              </p>
              <p>Matt was incredibly generous with his time, and took us into
                great detail about the struggles his organization was having
                tracking the success of the Hub. From this conversation we
                identified some critical pain points:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Inability to track and manage event attendees: <strong>
                    The Youth Hub is being sponsored by multiple organizations
                    who held responsibility for different types of events or
                    resources. This made it hard for them to track a Client’s
                    experience across the Hub. For instance, if a client met with
                    a social worker who recommended they go to a resume workshop,
                    it was hard for that social worker to know if they ended up
                    attending it. It was also difficult for organizations to
                    recognize if a Client was new to the Hub or returning. To
                    illustrate this, we learned that although Matt knew that 112
                    Clients had participated in Youth Hub events, only 40 had open
                    cases.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Difficulty in identifying trends and areas of interest:
                  </strong>Organizers might not know until the moment an event is
                  happening how many people are coming or interested. Being able
                  to see RSVPs on an app would help them know which events attract
                  more interest ahead of time. Moreover, by using a ticketing
                  system on the app they would not have to worry about manually
                  signing in attendees and following up with them later, but would
                  have all their information in one place already.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Challenges in getting youths interested and retaining
                    interest in Henry Street and partner events and activities:</strong>
                    This highlights a problem that is not unique to Henry Street--it’s
                    hard for institutions to reach out to young people in a way that
                    seems authentic and interesting. Matt thought an App would help
                    potential clients keep track of Youth Hub events using resources
                    they are already comfortable with (i.e. a cell phone).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </blockquote>
              <p>A solution to these problems had to both make it easy and rewarding
                for Youth Hub participants to engage with the Hub using resources
                they already had available (i.e. a smartphone) and make it easy for
                social workers, program coordinators, and stakeholders in each of
                the organizations sponsoring the event to track information. With
                this information, we outlined our objectives:

                  in the program, and the representatives of the organization
                  managing the program. Accordingly, we developed two personas
                  that could be representative of these groups:

                  important consideration for users when choosing a coworking
                  space. However, pricing plans vary across coworking spaces,
                  sometimes depending on how often a user will use the space,
                  whether they are reserving a seat, whether they are
                  signing up on a short-term or long term basis or other factors.</p>
                  <p>My initial solution was to look at the relative overall
                    prices of each coworking space and use a scale similar to
                    Yelp’s dollar sign feature to help users indicate whether
                    they were looking on the lower end or the higher end of the
                    pricing spectrum:</p>
                  <img src="images/wireframes/pricing_wireframe.png" class="u-one-half-width" alt="image">
                  <p class="spotlight-text">However, initial user feedback immediately made it clear
                  that this would not work. While people have a rough
                  understanding of what a $ meal is versus a $$$$ meal
                  (The difference between McDonalds and Per Se) there was nothing like the same
                  general knowledge about coworking space pricing. I had to
                  find a way to give people numbers they could filter by.
                  I went back to the pricing breakdown above, and looked for
                  commonalities. Eventually, I concluded that since most of the
                  spaces offered a daily and monthly pricing plan I could
                  utilize this to give more targeted ranges. I went through
                  and looked at the different daily and monthly offerings on
                  each of these spaces to come up with these broad ranges:</p>
                <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Daily Pricing: $20 - $150</li>
                    <li>Monthly Pricing: $80 - $1,000</li>
                  </ul>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Users had the ability to choose whether they were looking
                  for a daily or monthly price option when filtering, and
                  immediately got feedback on what the price ranges would be.
                  The response was much more positive--users wanted to have a
                  sense of actual dollar costs, and while these ranges were
                  broad they were effective in immediately anchoring them in
                  what prices were likely to be, and how to think about their
                  search.</p>

                  <h4>Prototype</h4>
                  <p>As a final deliverable, I built a prototype of the app using
                    Flinto. Flinto allowed me to design interactions for users

                <br>
                <p>I asked users to complete the following tasks:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Create an account</li>

            <h4>Research is key</h4>
            <p>The research I did into the coworking industry in New York and
              to benchmark apps in other verticals helped enormously in guiding
              this project. This baseline understanding allowed me to know
              exactly what gaps in my knowledge I needed users to fill, and
              which amenities and features I needed them to prioritize.
              Accordingly, when it came time to complete the information
              architecture I felt confident making decisions about information
              hierarchy and prioritization.</p>
            <h4>More user feedback</h4>
            <p>While I got some great feedback from my peers and my mentor on
              the earlier stages of the design, I would have liked to have
              widened the group giving feedback on the final prototype. User
              feedback was key to helping me re-approach the pricing filter,
              among other decisions. Time constraints prevented me from recruiting as
              many people who were entirely new to the project to review the final prototype. In
              an ideal world I would have liked to have observed more reactions to it.</p>
            <h4>Overall</h4>
            <p>This project represents a strong first version of an app that
              has great potential real world use. When prioritizing user stories for the
              MVP I deprioritized many that I believe would ultimately make it into
              a later version of this app, were it to be released. I could foresee this evolving,
              potentially in partnership with coworking spaces, and incorporating more search filters,
              amenities, or even cities beyond New York. There are many ways this
              could develop.</p>
