            <p>I designed and prototyped a website selling rare books as part of
              an e-commerce design project. I was drawn to working with rare
              books because they are deceptively difficult to categorize. While
              there is a well-established system around publishing and documenting
              books that predates the internet, and takes into account their title,
              author, publication information, and (as of the 20th century) their
              own unique ISBNs, the value of a rare book is equally dependent on
              that particular book’s condition. Many rare book marketplace give
              their sellers quite a bit of room to write detailed descriptions
              for this very reason, and often take great pains to describe warped
              binding, stains on certain pages, and fading on dustjackets.
            </p>
            <p>I set out to create a website that achieved the following:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
              <ol>
                <li>Utilized existing book categorization systems to help users
                  find specific books
                </li>
                <li>Enabled users to filter for specific conditions and rare editions
                </li>
                <li>Delighted the user with an aesthetically pleasing and highly
                  usable interface
                </li>
              </ol>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The result was First Impressions, a site that incorporated a search
              system that took advantage of existing book categorizations, while
              also giving casual and avid collectors the opportunity to filter
              their results to find books in good or reasonable condition. It
              was also deliberately designed to be more aesthetically pleasing
              and give the impression of being a bit higher-end than the average
              online bookstore, to underscore the quality of the products.

              <h4>Market Research</h4>
              <p>To start out, I conducted research on the rare book industry
                and best practices for ecommerce sites. After my preliminary
                research I identified four competitors to use as a benchmark for
                my product, and to use as the baseline for a SWOT analysis to
                help identify the best market positioning for the product:

            <h4>User Research</h4>
              <p>From my benchmark study I had identified common features
                consistently listed in the book details of my competitors:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
                <ul>
                  <li>Attributes (e.g. Author Signed, Dust Jacket, Illustrations)
                  </li>
                  <li>Condition
                  </li>
                  <li>Binding
                  </li>
                  <li>Publishing info (publishing house, edition/impression,
                    year printed)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </blockquote>
              <p>To find out how users would prioritize these features, I posted
                them to a SubReddit on Reddit devoted to rare books, and asked
                the members to rank them in order from most to least important.
                Most users told me that, if price was not a consideration, they
                would first check publishing information to make sure that this
                was the right book, and then the book’s condition was the most
                important factor in deciding whether that particular book was
                worth the purchase. Attributes were a nice to have, but would not
                outweigh the book’s condition or make a relatively common edition
                more valuable in most circumstances.
              </p>
              <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">

                </ol>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Most of these book collectors considered the category of “binding,”
                to be redundant or largely unimportant. A serious book collector
                already knows what the binding of a particular book should be from
                the publication date (e.g. a first edition of Fahrenheit 451 from
                1953 is a paperback because the book was first circulated as a paperback).
                While some people collect books with specialty bindings, such as tooled
                leather, this more of a niche collection market.
              </p>
              <p>Most importantly, I got my education in the importance of
                dustjackets from this user group. “A book without a dustjacket
                that should have one is extremely lacking in condition from the
                start and usually instantly loses 70-80% of its value,” one user
                told me.
              </p>
              <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">"A book without
              dustjacket that should have one is extremely lacking in condition from the
              start and usually instantly loses 70-80% of its value.”
            </blockquote>
              <p>Finally, I got some feedback from these book collectors about what
                their ideal book websites would look like, which primarily boiled
                down to being able to easily sort and filter for the book
                specifications they wanted. “Sortable by book condition/jacket
                condition would also be awesome. So condition fields have to be
                defined, something along F, NF, VG+, VG, VG-, G+, G, Fair. Also,
                check boxes and sortable attributes on book club and ex-library
                would be desirable as well.”

            <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
            <h4>Personas</h4>
            <p>Using both my market research and the primary user research from
              reddit, I created three user personas to guide my information architecture:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
              <ul>
                <li>Edward Rosier, a professional rare book/artifact dealer
                </li>
                <li>Julia Packet, a book collector
                </li>
                <li>Madeleine Hanna, a casual shopper trying to find a nice book for a friend
                </li>
              </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Edward represents a distillation of the users on reddit--a professional
              collector who would use the site to gauge market prices for books
              and occasionally buy something he thought was underprice or could
              get a better deal for elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>Julia, a book collector, is probably the most important user for this a
              site--someone who would buy things, but whose priorities were a
              mix of a rare book expert and a normal ecommerce shopper.

              much, and is easy to buy. I used these personas to guide the
              information architecture of the site.

              <h4>User Stories and User Flows</h4>
              <p>I referred to the user personas during the development of user flows.
                I prioritized specific flows based on which user personas would value
                or utilize the feature. They can be viewed in their entirety here.
                I then used these user stories to finalize my user flows.
              </p>
              <p>It was particularly important to me that users be able to purchase
                books from the site without creating accounts.</p>

              <p class="caption">Sample user flow</p>
              <p>My research indicated that requiring users to create an account
                is one of the most frequently cited reasons shoppers abandon their
                carts (along with unexpected additional fees and a long checkout
                process).
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
              <h4>Site-Map and Wireframes</h4>
              <p>After creating the flows, I created a site map and the initial
                wireframes for the site.
              </p>
              <p>A particularly difficult problem to determine visual groups for
                the book details. On any particular book page I needed to have
                the following information: Title, Author, Edition, Condition
                Publication Information, Price, Collectable details, Binding, ISBN,
                Shipping estimate (From browser location), Dustjacket.
              </p>
              <p>This is a lot of information to take in. I wanted to break these
                details down into logical subgroups, to help users easily browse to
                the information that was most important to them. To help me do that,
                I created a card sort activity asking 10 participants to group this
                information. After reviewing the results, and comparing it against
                the sites I used in my initial benchmark study, I came up with the
                below groupings:
              </p>
              <img src="images/First_Impressions/Book_features.png" class="u-max-full-width">
              <p>This helped me come up with a few wireframes for the detail page,
                which would go on to be refined later. The complete list of
                Wireframes is here.
              </p>
              <p>Finally, I took my rough wireframes and put together a very
                quick prototype for a user to search for a book, select the book,
                add to their cart, and checkout as a guest without creating an
                account. These were the bareboned MVP actions, and once I knew
                they were in place I was ready to start my visual design.

                  bookstore to be “First Impressions.” Before modern printing
                  methods, a first impression was a subset of a book’s edition.
                  It referred directly to how the the press had been manually arranged
                  to produce those particular copies of a book. If a books initial
                  printing was for 300 copies, the publisher would print those copies
                  and then rearrange the press for the next book. If they ran out
                  of those copies and wanted to print more, they would rearrange
                  the press and create the second impression. The second run would
                  still be considered a first edition, but a second impression.
                  This term is largely antiquated now with modern printing methods,
                  but would allude to older, historical books, which underscores
                  their collectability.
                </p>
                <p>“First Impressions” was also the original title of Jane Austen’s
                  “Pride and Prejudice”, which is less significant to the branding
                  of the store but still a fun literary touch.
                </p>
                <p>To bring this name to life, I used IM FELL DW Pica. The Fell
                  Types were developed by Peter De Walpergen and John Fell for
                  Fell’s Oxford-based “learned press” in the 17th century. Unsurprisingly,
                  given the age of the Typeface, it’s design evokes history, and
                  some of the effects of aging. The edges of the strokes waver visibly,
                  suggesting the press had been worn down or cut by hand. I’m particularly
                  partial to the slight nick in the dot of the “i” that prevents
                  it from being a fully formed oval. The character appears twice in
                  “First Impressions”, in both words, and creates a nice near symmetry
                  between them, as well as drawing the viewer’s eye above the cap
                  height over the other lowercase letters. In the case of “Impressions”,
                  which is a longer word, this also helps lend some needed visual variation.
                </p>

              <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
                <h4>Typefaces</h4>
                <p>I went back and forth on which typefaces to use for the header
                  and body text before settling on Lora and Lato, respectively.
                  I chose Lora because I wanted the headers to be in a serif font,
                  so as to be reminiscent books, and printing in general. Lato not
                  only pairs very well with Lora, it works well on screens even at
                  smaller sizes and the double-story character “a” and “g” keep the
                  font reminiscent of serif fonts and classic prints.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
                <h4>Colors</h4>
                <p>I wanted a color scheme for the site that would evoke a similar
                  sense of history as IM FELL DW Pica, but would still be visually
                  appealing and navigable on screens. After looking at different
                  sites and pictures for inspiration, I ended up relying heavily
                  the art of Jacques-Louis David. While David as a late 18th and
                  early 19th century painter certainly brings a sense of history,
                  I was mainly drawn to his work in this instance because of his
                  use of reds, blues and browns, which were often similar in shade
                  and intensity to the bindings of older books.

              <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
                <h4>User Interface</h4>
                <h5><strong>Homepage: </strong></h5>
                <p>The homepage needed to have a brief description of the site and
                  what it does, a prominent search display that demonstrated how users
                  should best use the site, and some initial content they could browse.
                </p>
                <img src ="images/First_Impressions/Landing_page_breakdown.png" class="u-max-full-width">
                <p>I used the red as my CTA color throughout the site, the blue
                  for accent color, and the tans and yellows as background on
                  featured or important information.
                </p>
                <p>Throughout the site I highlight authors names in blue. I did
                  this not only to introduce some variety into a very text heavy
                  site, but also because author, even more than title, is the best
                  feedback for users as to which book they’re looking at and whether
                  it’s the right one. Books can have similar or even the same titles,
                  and not all users are likely to know the publisher or ISBN of their
                  book--the user persona Madeleine certainly wouldn’t--so author
                  is best, fast way to guide users to the right selection.
                </p>
                <h5><strong>Search Results
                </strong></h5>
                <p>In my original wireframes I utilized a simple list view for
                  book results, similar to Abebooks, Bibliopolis, and Ebay.
                  However, it dawned on me that a grid-view result not only
                  allowed the viewer to see more results at once, it also had a
                  cleaner, more visually appealing affect that could stand out
                  strikingly against other rare book sellers.
                </p>
                <p>Accordingly I set to restructure the information granted for
                  each book in the listview, keeping Author, Title, and Price
                  immediately apparent, and offering Publisher and Condition when
                  viewers hovered. That would still allow users to quickly scan
                  for important information, made the page much cleaner overall.
                </p>
                <h5><strong>Detail View
                </strong></h5>
                <p>I also significantly reworked the detail view of the book.
                  Though my initial wireframe had called for putting the price
                  next to the image and the pertinent details and description
                  underneath, the pricing alone next to the picture looked empty.
                </p>
                <p>Instead I pulled all the books publisher information and
                  individual information up next to the main book picture,
                  keeping the detailed description alone below. In order to keep
                  the information visually separated into the categories I’d
                  determined during the card sort, I utilized extra spacing between
                  the publisher information and books specific condition, and used
                  borders above and below the pricing to literally separate it.
