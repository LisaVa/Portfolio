            <p>I designed and prototyped a website selling rare books as part of
              an e-commerce design project. I was drawn to working with rare books
              because they are deceptively difficult to categorize. While there
              exists a well-established system around publishing and documenting
              books that predates the internet, and takes into account their title,
              author, publication information, and (as of the 20th century) their
              own unique ISBNs, the value of a rare book is equally dependent on
              that particular book’s condition. Many rare book marketplaces give
              their sellers quite a bit of room to write detailed descriptions
              for this very reason, and often take great pains to describe warped
              binding, stains on certain pages, and fading on dustjackets.
            </p>
            <p>I set out to create a website that achieved the following:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
              <ol>
                <li>Utilized existing book categorization systems to help users find specific titles
                </li>
                <li>Enabled users to filter for specific conditions and rare editions
                </li>
                <li>Delighted the user with an aesthetically pleasing and highly
                  usable interface
                </li>
              </ol>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The result was First Impressions, a site that incorporated a search
              system that took advantage of existing book categorizations, while
              also giving casual and avid collectors the opportunity to filter
              their results to find books in good or reasonable condition. It was
              also deliberately designed to be more aesthetically pleasing and give
              the impression of being higher-end than the average online bookstore,
              to underscore the quality of the products.

              <h4>Market Research</h4>
              <p>To start out, I conducted research on the rare book industry
                and best practices for ecommerce sites. After my preliminary
                research, I identified four competitors to use as a benchmark
                for my product and to use as the baseline for a SWOT analysis to
                help identify the best market positioning for the product:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Amazon:</strong> An e-commerce giant universally associated with buying and selling books

                  <li><strong>eBay:</strong> An e-commerce company that creates a marketplace for users and businesses to sell their products

          <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
            <h4>User Research</h4>
              <p>From my benchmark study I identified common features consistently
                listed in the book details of my competitors:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
                <ul>
                  <li>Attributes (e.g. Author Signed, Dustjacket, Illustrations)
                  </li>
                  <li>Condition
                  </li>
                  <li>Binding
                  </li>
                  <li>Publishing info (publishing house, edition/impression,
                    year printed)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </blockquote>
              <p>To find out how users would prioritize these features, I posted
                them to a SubReddit on Reddit devoted to rare books and asked the
                members to rank them in order from most to least important. Most
                users told me that if price was not a consideration, they would
                first check publishing information to make sure that this was the
                right book, and then the book’s condition was the most important
                factor in deciding whether that particular book was worth the purchase.
                Attributes were a nice to have, but would not outweigh the book’s condition
                or make a relatively common edition more valuable in most circumstances.
              </p>
              <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
                <p><strong>Book Collectors Prioritization:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Publishing info (is this the title I want?)
                  </li>
                  <li>Condition (how valuable is this particular copy of that book)

                  </li>
                </ol>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Most of these book collectors considered the category of “binding,”
                to be redundant or largely unimportant. A serious book collector
                already knows what the binding of a particular book should be from
                the publication date (e.g. a first edition of Fahrenheit 451 from
                1953 is a paperback because the book was first circulated as a paperback).
                While some people collect books with specialty bindings, such as tooled
                leather, this more of a niche collection market.
              </p>
              <p>Most importantly, I got schooled in the importance of dustjackets
                from this user group. “A book without a dustjacket that should have
                one is extremely lacking in condition from the start and usually
                instantly loses 70-80% of its value,” one user told me.
              </p>
              <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">"A book without
              dustjacket that should have one is extremely lacking in condition from the
              start and usually instantly loses 70-80% of its value.”
            </blockquote>
              <p>Finally, I got some feedback from these book collectors about what
                their ideal book websites would look like, which primarily boiled
                down to being able to easily sort and filter for the book
                specifications they wanted. “Sortable by book condition/jacket
                condition would also be awesome. So condition fields have to be
                defined, something along F, NF, VG+, VG, VG-, G+, G, Fair. Also,
                check boxes and sortable attributes on book club and ex-library
                would be desirable as well.”

            <h4>Personas</h4>
            <p>Using both my market research and the primary user research from
              Reddit, I created<a href="pdfs//First_Impressions_User_Personas.pdf" class="underline">
                three user personas</a> to guide my information architecture:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
              <ul>
                <li>Edward Rosier, a professional rare book/artifact dealer
                </li>
                <li>Julia Packet, a book collector
                </li>
                <li>Madeleine Hanna, a casual shopper trying to find a nice book for a friend
                </li>
              </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Edward represents a distillation of the users on reddit--a professional
              collector who would use the site to gauge market prices for books
              and occasionally buy something he thought was underprice or could
              get a better deal for elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>Julia, a book collector, is probably the most important user for this
               site--someone who would buy things, but whose priorities were a mix
               of a rare book expert and a normal ecommerce shopper.

              <p>I referred to the user personas during the development of user
                flows. I prioritized specific flows based on which user personas
                would value or utilize the feature. They can be viewed in their
                entirety here. I then used these user stories to finalize my user flows.
              </p>
              <p>It was particularly important to me that users be able to purchase
                books from the site without creating accounts.</p>

              <p class="caption">Sample user flow</p>
              <p>My research indicated that requiring users to create an account
                is one of the most frequently cited reasons shoppers abandon their
                carts (along with unexpected additional fees and a long checkout
                process).
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
              <h4>Site-Map and Wireframes</h4>
              <p>After creating the flows, I created a site map and the initial
                wireframes for the site.
              </p>
              <p>A particularly difficult problem to determine visual groups for
                the book details. On any particular book page I needed to have
                the following information: Title, Author, Edition, Condition
                Publication Information, Price, Collectable details, Binding, ISBN,
                Shipping estimate (From browser location), Dustjacket.
              </p>
              <p>This is a lot of information to take in. I wanted to break these
                details down into logical subgroups, to help users easily browse to
                the information that was most important to them. To help me do that,
                I created a card sort activity asking 10 participants to group this
                information. After reviewing the results, and comparing it against
                the sites I used in my initial benchmark study, I came up with the
                below groupings:
              </p>
              <img src="images/First_Impressions/Book_features.png" class="u-max-full-width">
              <p>This helped me come up with a few wireframes for the detail page,
                which would go on to be refined later. The complete list of wireframes
                is <a href="pdfs/FI_Sitemap_and_Wireframes.pdf" class="underline">here.</a>
              </p>
              <p>Finally, I took my rough wireframes and put together a very quick

                prototype </a>for a user to search for a book, select the book, add to
                their cart, and checkout as a guest without creating an account.
                These were the bareboned MVP actions, and once I knew they were in
                place I was ready to start my visual design.

                <h4>Branding</h4>
                <p>I knew from very early on that I wanted the name of the bookstore
                  to be “First Impressions.” An impression refers to a particular
                  print run of a specific title. In the days of older printing
                  presses it explicitly referred to how the machine had been manually
                  arranged to produce the number of books in an order. If a titles’
                  initial order was for 300 copies, the publisher would print those
                  copies and then rearrange the press for the next book. If they ran
                  out of those copies and wanted to print more, they would rearrange
                  the press and create the second impression. The second run would
                  still be considered a first edition, but a second impression.
                  This term is largely antiquated now with modern printing methods,
                  but would allude to older, historical books, which underscores
                  their collectability.
                </p>
                <p>“First Impressions” was also the original title of Jane Austen’s
                  “Pride and Prejudice”, which is less significant to the branding
                  of the store but still a fun literary touch.
                </p>
                <p>To bring this name to life, I used IM FELL DW Pica. The Fell
                  Types were developed by Peter De Walpergen and John Fell for
                  Fell’s Oxford-based “learned press” in the 17th century. Unsurprisingly,
                  given the age of the Typeface, it’s design evokes history, and some
                  of the effects of aging.
                </p>
                <img src = "images/First_Impressions/First_Impressions_Logo_Blue.png" class="u-max-full-width">
                <p class="caption">The final logo.</p>
                <p>The edges of the strokes waver visibly,
                  suggesting the press had been worn down or cut by hand. I’m
                  particularly partial to the slight nick in the dot of the “i”
                  that prevents it from being a fully formed oval. The character
                  appears twice in “First Impressions”, in both words, and creates
                  a nice near symmetry between them, as well as drawing the viewer’s
                  eye above the cap height over the other lowercase letters. In the
                  case of “Impressions”, which is a longer word, this also helps lend
                  some needed visual variation.

              <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
                <h4>Typefaces</h4>
                <p>I went back and forth on which typefaces to use for the header
                  and body text before settling on Lora and Lato, respectively. I
                  chose Lora because I wanted the headers to be in a serif font,
                  so as to be reminiscent of books and printing in general. Lato
                  pairs very well with Lora and also works well on screens even
                  at smaller sizes. Additionally, the double-story character “a”
                  and “g” keep the font reminiscent of serif fonts and classic prints.

              <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
                <h4>Colors</h4>
                <p>I wanted a color scheme for the site that would evoke a similar
                  sense of history as IM FELL DW Pica, but would still be visually
                  appealing and navigable on screens. After looking at different
                  sites and pictures for inspiration, I ended up relying heavily
                  the art of Jacques-Louis David. While David as a late 18th and
                  early 19th century painter certainly brings a sense of history,
                  I was mainly drawn to his work in this instance because of his use of
                  reds, blues and browns, which were often similar in shade and
                  intensity to the bindings of older books.

              <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
                <h4>User Interface</h4>
                <h5><strong>Homepage: </strong></h5>
                <p>The homepage needed to have a brief description of the site
                  and what it does, a prominent search display that demonstrated
                  how users should best use the site, and some initial content
                  they could browse.
                </p>
                <img src ="images/First_Impressions/Landing_page_breakdown.png" class="u-max-full-width">
                <p>I used red as my CTA color throughout the site, blue for accent
                  color, and tans and yellows as background on featured or important
                  information.
                </p>
                <img src= "images/First_Impressions/FI_Landing_page_assets.png" class="u-max-full-width">
                <p>Throughout the site I highlight authors’ names in blue. I did
                  this not only to introduce some variety into a very text-heavy
                  site, but also because author, rather than title, is the best
                  indicator to users that they’re looking at the correct book.
                  Books can have similar or even the same titles, and not all
                  users are likely to know the publisher or ISBN of their book--the
                  user persona Madeleine certainly wouldn’t--so author is the best,
                  fastest way to guide users to the right selection.
                </p>
                <h5><strong>Search Results
                </strong></h5>
                <p>In my original wireframes I utilized a simple list view for book
                  results, similar to AbeBooks, Bibliopolis, and eBay. However, it
                  dawned on me that a grid view result not only allowed the viewer
                  to see more results at once, but also had a cleaner, more visually
                  appealing affect that could stand out strikingly against other
                  rare book sellers.
                </p>
                <img src="images/First_Impressions/Search_results_breakdown.png" class="u-max-full-width">
                <p>Accordingly I set to restructure the information granted for
                  each book in the listview, keeping author, title, and price
                  immediately apparent, and offering publisher and condition
                  when viewers hovered. That would still allow users to quickly
                  scan for important information, made the page much cleaner overall.
                </p>

                <p class="caption">Sample assets from the search results page.
                <h5><strong>Detail View
                </strong></h5>
                <p>I also significantly reworked the detail view of the book.
                  Though my initial wireframe had called for putting the price
                  next to the image and the pertinent details and description
                  underneath, the pricing alone next to the picture looked empty.
                </p>
                <p>Instead I pulled all the books publisher information and individual
                  information up next to the main book picture, keeping the detailed
                  description alone below. In order to keep the information visually
                  separated into the categories I’d determined during the card sort,
                  I utilized extra spacing between the publisher information and books
                  specific condition, and used borders above and below the pricing to
                  literally separate it.

                    in InVision to:</p>

              <h2>Reflection</h2>
              <h4>Visual Design Execution</h4>
              <p>It was important to me that the visual design of this site be impressive
              and evocative of a higher-end shopping experience. Many e-commerce
              sites are almost cluttered in their visual layout, because they want
              to maximize the information the user takes in to encourage additional
              spending. Rare books do not really lend themselves well to this, because
              they are generally a bit more expensive, and not something where people
              are as inclined to impulse-buy. I think the typesystem, use of whitespace,
              and interactions create the sensation of a high-end shopping experience.
              </p>
              <h4>More Targeted Usability Research</h4>
              <p>While I chose a grid layout for the search results page to keep
              the overall visual design cleaner, in an ideal world I would have
              liked to A/B test the two layouts to see which users were able to navigate
              faster. Although I still believe that the grid design is more visually
              appealing, it’s not as easy to scan through all the pertinent details
              for each book.
              </p>
              <h4>Overall</h4>
              <p>I think the work I did on this site design would make it an
              effective used and rare book store. Were the site to be launched
              in real life, I would anticipate that over time we would add more
              features, such as the ability to search by publisher, adding
              additional filters to the search results (e.g. language), and
              building out the featured content on the homepage to try and encourage
              browsing.
