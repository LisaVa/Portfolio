              management, content writing, and stakeholder engagement. After
              graduating in 2013 I spent three and a half years working at
              Business Talent Group (BTG), where I began in sales but quickly
              switched to a role on the Client Service team that gave plenty of
              scope to my people-oriented approach, strategic organization, and
              creativity. As a designer, I leverage these skills to understand
              how users expect to engage with products and designing intuitive
              processes to to meet these expectations. I am currently completing
              a UX Design Apprenticeship through Bloc, and am eager to join a

                <h3>Career</h3>
                <p>I graduated from Barnard College in 2013 with a degree in History,
              and immediately joined an exciting company called Business Talent
              Group (BTG). BTG was one of the earliest professional services
              firms to capitalize on the growing gig-economy, and their business
              model is centered on enabling global companies to engage independent
              consultants or experts for project-based work. I ended up spending
              three and a half years at this amazing company, beginning in sales
              but quickly moving over to client service and program management.
              Through this experience, I learned that professionally my strongest
              skills and the roles I am most drawn to are people-oriented, highly
              organized and efficiency-driven, and creative.
              </p>
              <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
              <h4>People-oriented</h4>
              <p>I had initially pursued sales as a career because I am a
                highly extroverted person and enjoy working with people to
                understand their goals. However, I rapidly realized that the
                frontline sales is fundamentally a volume game, and that while I
                might get to reach out to many people on any given day, conversations
                and exchanges were going be brief and not give that much scope
                the relationship-building or problem solving I craved.
             </p>
             <p>
               Fortunately for me, my manager helped me identify that with my
               writing skills and organization I was a much stronger fit for our
               Client Service team. At BTG, Client service is responsible for
               working with clients from the moment they have a specific project
               for a consultant through the consultant’s last day. This gave
               plenty of scope for my people-skills; I got to work clients on
               a longer-term basis to understand their goals, and became highly
               skilled in identifying these, both the explicit (e.g. “find me a
               consultant who knows supply-chain”) and the unstated (“Also this
               person needs to be a good coach who won’t terrify my new,
               inexperienced right-hand support but rather help them build the
               skills they need”).
             </p>
             <p>
               I became particularly skilled at the latter, and was generally
               able to quickly identify clients who knew exactly what they want
               from clients who needed a bit more help scoping, to clients who
               had reached out to use on a trial basis or to satisfy an internal
               vendor outreach quota and weren’t likely to actually engage.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
            <h4>Strategically Organized</h4>
              <p>The Client Service role also capitalized on my natural organization
                and efficiency. The life-cycle for projects has many steps: after
                the initial client interview we identified consultants from our n
                etwork who look like a promising fit, screened them, wrote
                targeted bios of them, worked with the final candidate(s) on a
                formal proposal, handled all the project contracting and
                coordinating once it was greenlit, and then stay in touch with
                both consultant(s) and client(s) throughout the project to ensure
                its success. There were many details to keep track of and
                forgetting any of them could derail a project. I am by nature
                someone who not only understands how to implement processes,
                but am also able to understand the reason why behind them, and
                before long I was not only navigating a high volume of projects,
                I was also better ways to organize myself. I would create dashboards in salesforce
                to help me track progress at across the board, lists of go-to consultants for
                specific roles or clients, and reusable templates for specific proposal types.
              </p>
              <p>Before long I was not only managing a higher volume of proposals
                than the average associate, I was also responsible for helping
                review the operations of the whole team. I would monitor team
                dashboards, and reach out to associates on teams that seemed
                stuck on a particular step of the process, or remind them to
                update steps we needed for compliance. This also gave my
                people-skills a chance to shine--it’s very tough to coach your
                peers without causing offence, and finding the best way to do
                this took some thought.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
            <h4>Creativity</h4>
              <p>	My people skills and organization meant that I accelerated
                rapidly in the Client Service role; within a year of joining
                the team I was promoted to Senior Associate, and a year after
                that I was a Program Manager formally spearheading my own
                projects and managing an Associate. However, my last phase at
                BTG allowed my creativity to shine through an increasing
                responsibility designing and writing proposals.</p>
              <p>Throughout the client service role I had drawn praise for my
                writing skills; as an associate I wrote great, fast consultant
                bios, and as a Program Manager I was able continue to hone my
                writing and editing skills putting together formal proposals,
                often working with consultants with decades more career experience
                than myself to help them appeal to particular clients or position
                their work. This included designing visually appealing powerpoints,
                graphs and templates, which I hugely enjoyed. By the end of 2016 as a
                program manager I was increasingly recruited by senior leadership to
                work with teams handling especially complex RFPs, proposals, or client
                life-cycles, and this was by far and away my favorite aspect of my job
                during this time.
              </p>
              <p>When I was promoted to Senior Program Manager in January 2017,
              it was with the understanding that I was going to formally work on
              the BTG proposal response function, specifically around RFP’s
              (requests for proposals) and help create reusable, dynamic templates
              to help us respond to these more efficiently and more appealingly.
              I threw myself into adapting my recent proposal efforts into broader
              templates, and writing original case studies that could be pulled quickly
              into proposals, and by the time I left BTG six months later we were well on our
              way to a more robust process.
              </p>
          </div>
          <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
            <h4>Finding UX</h4>
              <p>Even while working on this exciting new project, I knew that
                ultimately the time was coming for the next phase of my career.
                While the roles at BTG had offered plenty of scope for my skill to
                join, I knew long term I wanted to find something different for myself.
                I wals always jealous of the consultants I placed on projects, who often
                got to build something lasting and long term at their various clients.
                While I loved working with people, I wanted to build things too.</p>
              <p>I also had a lifetime interest in technology, which I had
                relatively limited scope to utilize in my role at BTG. However
                in college I had had an internship where I was responsible for
                spearheading the redesign of a website, and I had enjoyed
                interviewing stakeholders, analyzing user surveys, and sketching
                wireframes. In hindsight I realized that had been one of the most
                enjoyable projects of my short career, and realized that
                approaching it again with my experience at BTG would make me
                highly skilled at it. My people-oriented background would inform
                user research and interviews, the strategic organization as a
                program manager would help build-in logical steps and processes in
                 my products, and the creativity as a writer and proposal designer
                 would shine in wireframes and visual design.</p>
                <p>However, I knew I would need a grounding in UX principles before
                  I found a role, so after looking at various graduate school programs
                  and bootcamps I decided to enroll in Bloc’s UX Design Apprenticeship.
                  Bloc offers an immersive User Experience Design program that focuses on
                  User Experience, Visual Design, and Coding fundamentals (HTML, CSS,
                  Javascript). The selling point for me was that students are paired with
                  a professional UX Designer who coaches them 1:1 multiple times a week,
                  providing informed and personalized feedback on their work and progress.
                  Given my extroverted nature I had initially shied away from online programs,
                  but this level of individual attention was incredible, and sold me on Bloc.
                </p>
                <p>And I’m very glad it did, because thanks to a thoughtful
                  curriculum and a highly experienced mentor I feel prepared and
                  ready to take on my first UX role, utilizing the skills I’ve
                  developed over my career and at Bloc, and the toolsets I’m
                  knowledgeable in.</p>
