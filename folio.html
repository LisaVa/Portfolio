            <p>Folio is a notetaking and content-sharing platform I researched,
              structured and designed as part of my coursework for Bloc. The
              challenge in this three-week concept project was devising a new
              platform in the already saturated market of web applications that
              allow people to collect and store information.
            </p>
            <img src="" class="u-max-full-width" alt=" ">
            <p>The platform needed to adhere to the business requirements of the
              the assignment, but go a step beyond in identifying user frustrations
              with their current information storing solutions to help make the
              final product stand out from the crowded business landscape.</p>

                and content-sharing space.</p>
            <p>To address this, I set out to research and design an interface
              that accomplished the following:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="offset-by-one column">
              <ol>
                <li>Captured all the pages and flows required by the business
                  requirements (e.g. landing page, dashboard page, account onboarding).
                </li>
                <li>Identified user pain-points with other notetaking and content
                  sharing platforms, and find ways to address them within the
                  business requirements.
                </li>
                <li>Created a unique and visually distinctive visual design and
                  branding that sets the platform apart in a crowded landscape.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </blockquote>
            <p>My solution was Folio, an application that met the business
              requirements but added additional search and organizational
              functionality for users to track and find their content. My
              branding plan was also constructed with an eye to set Folio apart
              from its competitors.

              <h4>Market Research</h4>
              <p>My first step was to conduct a high-level SWOT analysis on
                existing platforms that allow users to store information. I
                compared Box.com, Evernote and Google’s note-taking platform Keep.
                These three provided a solid introduction to the market. Strikingly,
                all three are positioned as both a consumer and business solution,
                though they fell across a broad spectrum between these markets.
                Box was primarily focused on it’s B2B offering, Evernote promoted
                both with an emphasis on its business solutions, and Keep is
                still primarily a consumer solution despite its recent integration
                into G Suite (Google’s business targeted suite of applications
                aimed at businesses).
              </p>

              <blockquote class="offset-by-one column eleven columns">
                Strikingly, all three are positioned as both a consumer and business solution,
                though they fell across a broad spectrum between these markets.
              </blockquote>
             <p>This clarified that the purpose of the user research should be
               to identify where along this spectrum my note-taking and content
               sharing app should try to position itself.
             </p>
          </div>
          <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
            <h4>Survey</h4>
              <p>In light of this analysis I built a survey to send out to a
                variety of respondents (students and professionals aged 18+).
                The survey indicated that the majority of respondents were equally
                likely to be taking notes or saving/sharing content for personal
                reasons or for work/professional reasons. Comments in the notes
                indicated a general fatigue with the plethora of options available
                to them, and a frustration with how to easily access their notes
                or content across different environments.
              </p>
              <p>It also indicated that note-taking in particular was viewed as
                a highly personal activity. While most expected to share photos
                or links, almost no respondents expected to share their notes
                with other individuals, either professionally or in their personal
                lives.
              </p>
              <p>Some additional take-aways from the survey, and how people
                generally save/share content and take notes can be found below:

            <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
            <h4>Personas</h4>
            <p>Using these responses, I created three <a href="pdfs/folio_personas.pdf" class="underline">user personas</a> to guide the
              development of the platform.</p>

            <p class="caption">Sample user profile for Folio.</p>
            <p>While it would be difficult to design a solution all three would
              find ideal, the takeaways from the survey I tried to imbue in each
              of them are:</p>
            <blockquote class="offset-by-one column">
              <ol>
                <li>Users want to be able to take notes quickly</li>
                <li>Users want to be able to easily find content they save</li>
                <li>Users want to be to access content and notes across
                  devices/environments</li>
              </ol>
            </blockquote>

              <p>While the user stories, user flows  were fairly straight were
              fairly straightforward, the wireframes proved challenging. The dashboard
              should offer users a variety of options and functionalities, and
              determining their visual prioritization was not an easy task. My
              first attempt was too busy to have a clear hierarchy:</p>

              <p class="caption">By putting favorites and tags in the side navivation bar along with

              <p>After review I realized that by combining the types of items
              one can add (notes, images and links) with functionalities like
              “favorite” and “tags”, I had diluted the clarity of the navigation.
              Subsequently, I revised the design, so that only item types
              and designated folders were on the side navigation. I moved
              collaborators to account settings, and added a sort by
              functionality and a search to the main dashboard area to help
              users quickly find items they want to edit.</p>

                <h4>Branding</h4>
                <p>After my SWOT analysis I decided it was important to come up
                  with a unique niche within the content storing/note-taking landscape
                  for Folio. I also decided to position the product as a solution for
                  creatives, both in order to appeal to the fierce individuality
                  that emerged when people discussed their note-taking and content
                  saving habits, and to capitalize on a part of the market where
                  I saw an opening. Box, Evernote, and even Google’s Keep are clearly
                  positioning themselves as business solutions in the white-collar,
                  traditional office sense. My having a more creative undertone I
                  thought my product would stand out from the crowd and potentially
                  have a stronger appeal to creative agencies and individuals who
                  either are or believe themselves to be engaged in more imaginative
                  endeavors.

                <p><strong>Logo: </strong>I chose folio as the name for this
                  platform. At this point it is used largely in historical contexts,
                  but as it literally refers to a book or gather of written pages I
                  thought it fit a notetaking app. Moreover, the historical associations
                  underscored the creative angle I was going for--we mostly here the word
                  now used in old books or in association with versions of Shakespeare’s
                  works.

                  headings, and I paired it with Work Sans as the body text. Work
                  Sans is a designed for screen use and is clear across all devices.
                  Raleway is also optimized for screens, but the small, grotesque-style
                  details in its lettering give it a more old-fashioned feel that pairs
                  well with the name Folio.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Color scheme: </strong>With color-selection I was
                  highly conscious of avoiding color schemes already used by
                  competitors in the space (e.g. the light green of Evernote or
                  the medium blues of Box and Dropbox) The complementary purple
                  and yellow color scheme utilizes the creative associations that
                  purple brings to underscore the creative brand positioning, and
                  the yellow is a bright accent color that helps illuminate calls-to-action
                  (CTAs) throughout the site.

                <h4>User Testing</h4>
                  <p>Since adding new content was one of the most important
                    functionalities of this platform, especially in light of
                    survey respondents complaining about how heavy-weight notetaking
                    apps can be, I conducted a nav test to see if new users could
                    easily figure out how to add content. Users completed the task
                    between one and six seconds.

            <p>This was the first platform I designed as part of my UX Design
              coursework, so my learning curve was very streep throughout. While
              I think some of the greatest strengths of the final design are within
              the dashboard organization, particularly in adding the search
              functionality to the side-nav and giving users the ability to sort
              their content, I believe I could have gone farther in making this
              easily navigable.
            </p>
            <p>For instance, I had the chance to go back and do it again I would
              like to test whether people would want to the option to to sort their
              content by favorites. My decision in giving people the user the option
              to sort their content by date created, date last modified, and title,
              was based on seeing how competitors sorted their content. However, I
              would have liked to do my own organic testing around that to see if
              there were other ways users would like to sort the content on their dashboard.
            </p>
            <p>Overall I think the design executes very well against the business
              requirements, and goes an extra step with a branding scheme that sets
              it apart from real competitors.
