            <p>While there are an incredible number of coworking spaces available
              in New York, there are surprisingly few resources to help New Yorkers
               find the right coworking space for them. As a design challenge,
               I set out to research, design, and prototype a location-based app
               that users to identify and compare coworking spaces in New York City.
            </p>
            <p>I structured this project around the following user problems:</p>
            <blockquote class="offset-by-one column">
              <ol>
                <li>Users want to find coworking spaces that are geographically convenient</li>
                <li>Users want to view the details of the space and easily compare it to other spaces</li>
                <li>Users want to easily save and share the coworking spaces they find</li>
                <li>Users want read reviews of these spaces, and write their own reviews after using them</li>
              </ol>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The location-based app I ultimately designed solves a two-sided
              problem: it both represents what the coworking industry currently
              offers freelancing New Yorkers, and prioritizes the features people
              considered most important when choosing a workspace. With Gowork,
              users are able to easily search by location, filter by price and
              features, and read what other users have to say about their experience
              at different spaces. Moreover, with an account they can save workspaces
              they are interested in, and write their own reviews to contribute
              to the broader community.

              <h4>Market Research</h4>
              <p>The first step was to look at what coworking spaces in New York
               offer their users. To do this, I assessed five coworking
              options by price, location, and amenities. I selected a major
               chain/name brand site (WeWork), a smaller, lesser known chain
               (Spacious), and three individual sites (The Productive and The Farm in Manhattan, and Bat Haus in Brooklyn)
                to keep this data representative. You can see my assessment
               <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i7Bx36Fvt5TOgpLRP2iVFGs3_aF2FDJAtGRuUgYF7r4"
                class= "underline">here.</a>
             </p>
             <p>
               To get a sense of what similar apps in other verticals
               prioritize, I conducted a benchmark study of Yelp, Aribnb,
               Seamless (a food ordering app) and StreetEasy (a New York-based
               real estate app).

            <h4>Survey</h4>
            <p>After conducting market research, I had enough information
              to build a framework for my user research. I was well versed in
               what features coworking spaces offered, where they were located,
                and the numerous pricing plans they offered, but I did
                not know how users prioritized these. But I still needed to understand
                what users wanted to know about coworking.
                Accordingly, I built a survey to answer the following questions:
              </p>
          <blockquote class="offset-by-one column">
            <ol>
              <li>
              How interested are users in coworking, and how frequently
              would they utilize a coworking space?
              </li>
              <li>
              Which features are most important when users choose a
              coworking space?
              </li>
              <li>
              Which amenities would they most like to have in a coworking
              space?
              </li>
              <li>
              How likely would they be to use a coworking space to work
              with others?
              </li>
            </ol>
          </blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
            <h4>Survey Results</h4>
            <p>I circulated the survey amongst a group of students and
              freelance/remote professionals. Results showed that 75% were
              interested in coworking and would ideally like to use a coworking
              space more than once a week.</p>
              <p>Respondents were asked to prioritize a standardized list of
                coworking features and amenities based on the five coworking
                spaces I had assessed. Unsurprisingly, people chose pricing and
                location as the most important consideration when choosing a
                coworking space. There was a significant drop off between these
                two and the other choices. Ultimately, when respondents’
                responses were averaged the features were prioritized as follows
                (in order of highest to lowest priority):</p>
              <blockquote class="offset-by-one column">
                <ol>
                  <li>Pricing</li>
                  <li>Location</li>
                  <li>Reserved seating</li>
                  <li>User reviews</li>
                  <li>Available amenities</li>
                  <li>Accessibility outside business hours</li>
                </ol>
              </blockquote>
              <p>More surprisingly, the most popular amenities people wanted a
                coworking space to have were printing and scanning services,
                available refreshments, and presentation and meeting rooms. The
                full list of amenities, in order or highest to lowest priority,
                was as follows:</p>
                <blockquote class="offset-by-one column">
                  <ol>
                    <li>Printing/scanning Services</li>
                    <li>Available refreshments</li>
                    <li>Presentation and meeting rooms</li>
                    <li>Space to collaborate with colleagues</li>
                    <li>Social/community events (e.g. happy hours, networking
                      opportunities, brown-bag lunches)</li>
                    <li>Package and mail delivery services</li>
                  </ol>
                </blockquote>
              <p>Finally, while the majority expressed interest in using a
                coworking space to collaborate with colleagues or meet with
                clients, this was generally expressed as being “somewhat interested”
                as opposed to “very interested.”</p>

            <div class="case-study-sub-subsection">
            <h4>Personas</h4>
            <p>After gathering this information from the survey respondents,
               I condensed the most popular responses into
               <a href="//drive.google.com/open?id=0BzNVPXAu4MtWaURNcjFzM2JMdUU" class="underline">
                 three personas</a>.</p>

                should have to narrow their search results. The items highlighted in
                red are the most critical, and were included in this MVP. Yellow
                highlighted items are secondary features, and the blue are the least critical.

                <p>I prioritized the two most popular amenities, printing services
                 and available beverages, and grouped them with reserved seating
                 for the initial amenities. I chose to move reserved
                 seating from a feature to an amenity to condense the number of
                 filters in the search functionality of
                 the app, and because on further review it seemed to fit better
                  with amenities. The other features have a universal aspect
                  (hours, pricing, location) that could easily be found in any
                  industry, but reserve seating is more specific, and in
                  hindsight fit better with amenities.</p>

                  relatively low overall on features, I opted to keep in the MVP
                  for three reasons:</p>
                  <blockquote class="offset-by-one column">
                    <ol>
                      <li>A significant minority ranked it as their number 1
                      consideration (around 10% of respondents).</li>
                      <li>My benchmark study of apps in other verticals indicated
                      hours of operation is a standard feature, leading to the
                      concern users would expect to see it.</li>
                      <li>Research into the freelance/independent workforce
                      indicated that many work irregular hours or are
                      freelancing part-time/on top of daytime commitments. This
                      lead me to conclude that despite the survey results a
                      significant number of users might find this an important consideration.</li>
                    </ol>

                      The benefits of having an account are being able to save your
                      favorite spaces and review the ones you have visited. However,
                      given the newness of the app concept I wanted to account for
                      the fact that users may want to explore the app and its features
                      before signing up, and allow them to do so, rather than lose
                      them at the onboarding.</p>

                <h4>Spotlight on pricing</h4>
                <p>Survey results indicated that pricing was by far the most
                  important consideration for users when choosing a coworking
                  space. However, pricing plans vary across coworking spaces,
                  sometimes depending on how often a user will use the space,
                  whether they are reserving a seat, whether they are
                  signing up on a short-term or long term basis or other factors.</p>
                  <p>My initial solution was to look at the relative overall
                    prices of each coworking space and use a scale similar to
                    Yelp’s dollar sign feature to help users indicate whether
                    they were looking on the lower end or the higher end of the
                    pricing spectrum:</p>
                  <img src="images/wireframes/pricing_wireframe.png" class="u-one-half-width" alt="image">
                  <p class="spotlight-text">However, initial user feedback immediately made it clear
                  that this would not work. While people have a rough
                  understanding of what a $ meal is versus a $$$$ meal
                  (The difference between McDonalds and Per Se) there was nothing like the same
                  general knowledge about coworking space pricing. I had to
                  find a way to give people numbers they could filter by.
                  I went back to the pricing breakdown above, and looked for
                  commonalities. Eventually, I concluded that since most of the
                  spaces offered a daily and monthly pricing plan I could
                  utilize this to give more targeted ranges. I went through
                  and looked at the different daily and monthly offerings on
                  each of these spaces to come up with these broad ranges:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Daily Pricing: $20 - $150</li>
                  </tr>
                  <li>Monthly Pricing: $80 - $1,000</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Users had the ability to choose whether they were looking
                  for a daily or monthly price option when filtering, and
                  immediately got feedback on what the price ranges would be.
                  The response was much more positive--users wanted to have a
                  sense of actual dollar costs, and while these ranges were
                  broad they were effective in immediately anchoring them in
                  what prices were likely to be, and how to think about their
                  search.</p>

                  <p>As a final deliverable, I built a prototype of the app using
                    Flinto. Flinto allowed me to design interactions for users

                <br>
                <p>I asked users to complete the following tasks:</p>
                <blockquote class="offset-by-one column">
                  <ol>
                    <li>Create an account</li>

                    <li>Favorite their coworking space</li>
                    <li>Write a review of the space</li>

                </blockquote>
                <p>Results showed that users were able to complete the assigned

            <h4>Research is key</h4>
            <p>The research I did into the coworking industry in New York and
              to benchmark apps in other verticals helped enormously in guiding
              this project. This baseline understanding allowed me to know
              exactly what gaps in my knowledge I needed users to fill, and
              which amenities and features I needed them to prioritize.
              Accordingly, when it came time to complete the information
              architecture I felt confident making decisions about information
              hierarchy and prioritization.</p>
            <h4>More user feedback</h4>
            <p>While I got some great feedback from my peers and my mentor on
              the earlier stages of the design, I would have liked to have
              widened the group giving feedback on the final prototype. User
              feedback was key to helping me re-approach the pricing filter,
              among other decisions. Time constraints prevented me from recruiting as
              many people who were entirely new to the project to review the final prototype. In
              an ideal world I would have liked to have observed more reactions to it.</p>
            <h4>Overall</h4>
            <p>This project represents a strong first version of an app that
              has great potential real world use. When prioritizing user stories for the
              MVP I deprioritized many that I believe would ultimately make it into
              a later version of this app, were it to be released. I could foresee this evolving,
              potentially in partnership with coworking spaces, and incorporating more search filters,
              amenities, or even cities beyond New York. There are many ways this
              could develop.</p>
