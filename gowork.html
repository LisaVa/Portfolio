            <p>Though the number of coworking spaces in New York City has grown
              exponentially in the past few years, there are surprisingly few
              resources to help potential users find the right coworking space
              for them.
              Freelancers and other potential coworkers may use standard
              crowd-sourced solutions such as Yelp, but these are not tailored
              to screen for specific worker needs.
              Similarly, while larger coworking solutions such as WeWork offer
              maps to identify their locations, this naturally limits the user
              to only one coworking option.

            <p>Given the success of platforms that help locate and compare space
               options in numerous other markets (for instance, Priceline in the
              travel market, Seamless in the restaurant market)
              I believed that offering a similar solution in the Coworking space
               will offer a needed solution to thousands of NYC based users.

            <p>I conducted extensive research on the freelance market and
              coworking spaces in NYC to support the development of this app.
            </p>
            <h4>Secondary Research</h4>
            <p>The first step was to look at what coworking spaces in New York
              city offer their users. To do this, I assessed  4 coworking
              options here by Price, Location, and Amenities. I selected a major
               chain/name brand site (WeWork), a smaller, lesser known chain
               (Spacious), and two individual sites (one in Manhattan, one in
               Brooklyn) to keep this data reprsentative. You can see my
               assessment here.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
               To get a sense of what similar apps in other verticals have
               prioritized, I conducted a benchmark study of Yelp, Aribnb,
               Seamless (a food ordering app) and StreetEasy (a New York-based
               real estate app).

            <h4>Survey</h4>
            <p>After conducting my secondary research, I had enough information
              to build a framework for my primary research. I was well versed in
               what features coworking spaces offered, where they were located,
                and the multitude of pricing plans they leveraged, but I did
                not know how users prioritized this. Before I built my app, I
                needed to know what users most wanted to know about coworking.
                Accordingly, I built a survey to answer the following questions:
              </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
              How interested are people in coworking, and how frequently
              would they utilize a coworking space?
              </li>
              <li>
              What features are most important when people choose a
              coworking space?
              </li>
              <li>
              What amenities would they most like to have in a coworking
              space?
              </li>
              <li>
              How likely would they be to use a coworking space to work
              with others?
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Survey Results</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>How interested are people in coworking, and how frequently
                would they utilize a coworking space?</li>

              <li>What features are most important when people choose a
                coworking space?<p class="italic">Users were asked to prioritize
                   a list of features from most to least important. The higher
                   the score of the feature, the more people had prioritized
                   highly. The results were as follows:</p>
              </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Pricing (96)</li>

                  The results were as follows:</p>

                     they generally were not strongly interested
                     (somewhat interested as opposed to interested).
                   </li>
                   <li>Similarly, the while there was interest in using
                     coworking space to meet with clients, the majority who
                     expressed this interest only described themselves as being
                     “somewhat interested.""

            <h4>Personas</h4>
            <p>After gathering this information from the survey respondents,
               I condensed the most popular responses into three personas.</p>

              persona to help with the prioritization of user stories and
              flows in the next section</p>
            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <h4>User Stories</h4>
            <p>The initial list of User Stories took into account all my
               findings from my primary and secondary research </p>
              <p>I then used the survey results to prioritize features for the
                initial MVP. In the example below, I prioritized filters that users
                should have to narrow their search results. The items highlighted in
                red are the most critical, and were included in this MVP. Yellow
                highlighted items are secondary features, and the blue are the least critical.
              </p>
              <img src="images/Prioritized_user_stories.png" class="u-full-width">
              <p class="caption">Prioritized user stories.</p>
              <p>I prioritized the two most popular amenities (Printing services
                 and available beverages) and paired them with reserved seating
                 for our initial amenities features. I chose to move reserved
                 seating from a feature to an amenity to condense the number of
                 filters in the search functionality of the first version of
                 the app, and because on further review it seemed to fit better
                  with amenities. The other features have a universal aspect
                  (hours, pricing, location) that could easily be found in any
                  industry, but reserve seating is more specific, and in
                  hindsight fit better with amenities.</p>
                  <br>
                <p>Accessibility outside business hours: While this scored
                  relatively low overall on features, I opted to keep in the MVP
                  for 3 reasons:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>A significant minority ranked it as their number 1
                      consideration (around 10% of respondents).</li>
                    <li>My benchmark study of apps in other verticals indicated
                      hours of operation is a standard feature, leading to the
                      concern users would expect to see it</li>
                    <li>Research into the freelance/independent workforce
                      indicated that many work irregular hours or are
                      freelancing part time/on top of daytime commitments,
                      leading me to believe that despite the survey results a
                      significant number of users might find this useful (in my
                      user personas, both the entrepreneur and the writer would
                      potentially benefit from this feature)</li>
                  </ol>
                <img src="">
              <h4>User Flows</h4>
              <p>After creating the user stories it was time to map out the user
                flows:</p>
              <img src="images/user_flows/search_from_landing+page.png" class="u-full-width">
              <p class="caption">Sample user flow</p>
              <img src="images/user_flows/returning_user_edit_reviews.png" class="u-full-width">
              <p class="caption">Sample user flow</p>
              <p>It was important to me that those who opt to skip making an
                account still be able to search and filter for coworking spaces.
                The benefits of having an account are being able to save your
                favorite spaces and review the ones you have visited. However,
                given the newness of the app concept I wanted to account for
                the fact that users may want to explore the app and its features
                 before signing up, and allow them to do so, rather than lose
                 them at the onboarding.</p>
              <h4>Wireframes</h4>
              <p>Once my user flows were finalized, it was time to begin visualizing my app. I sketched out wireframes of each of the pages, and once that was completed I made a quick prototype in InVision to spot-check I hadn’t left out any crucial steps or images.

                <h4>Spotlight on pricing</h4>
                <p>Survey results indicated that pricing was by far the most
                  important consideration for users when choosing a Coworking
                  space. However, pricing plans vary across coworking spaces,
                  often depending on how often a user will use the space,
                  whether they are reserving a seat, and whether they are
                  signing up on a short-term or long term basis.</p>
                  <p>My initial solution was to look at the relative overall
                    prices of each coworking space and use a scale similar to
                    Yelp’s dollar sign feature to help users indicate whether
                    they were looking on the lower end or the higher end of the
                    pricing spectrum:</p>
                  <img src="images/wireframes/landing_page_dropdown.png" class="pricing_image" alt="image">
                  <p class="spotlight-text">However, initial user feedback immediately made it clear
                  that this would not work. While people have a rough
                  understanding of what a $ meal is versus a $$$$ meal
                  (McDonalds versus Per Se) there was nothing like the same
                  general knowledge about coworking space pricing. I had to
                  find a way to give people numbers they could filter by.
                  I went back to the pricing breakdown above, and looked for
                  commonalities. Eventually, I concluded that since all the
                  spaces offered a daily and monthly pricing plan I could
                  utilize this to give more targeted ranges. I went through
                  and looked at the different daily and monthly offerings on
                  each of these spaces to come up with these broad ranges:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Daily Pricing: $20 - $150</li>
                  </tr>
                  <li>Monthly Pricing: $80 - $1,000</td>
                </ul>
                <p>Users had the ability to choose whether they were looking
                  for a daily or monthly price option when filtering, and
                  immediately got feedback on what the price ranges would be.
                  The response was much more positive--users wanted to have a
                  sense of actual dollar costs, and while these ranges were
                  broad they were effective in immediately anchoring them in
                  what prices were likely to be, and how to think about their
                  search.</p>

            <h4>Reflection is key</h4>
            <p>The research I did into the coworking industry in New York and
              to benchmark apps in other verticals helped enormously is guiding
              this project. This baseline understanding allowed me to know
              exactly what gaps in my knowledge I needed users to fill, and
              which amenities and features I needed them to prioritize.
              Accordingly, when it came time to complete the information
              architecture I felt confident making decisions about information
              hierarchy and prioritization.</p>
            <h4>More user feedback</h4>
            <p>While I got some great feedback from my peers and my mentor on
              the earlier stages of the design, I would have liked to have
              widened the group giving feedback on the final prototype. User
              feedback was key to helping me re-approach the pricing filter,
              among other decisions. Given time constraints I did not have time
              to recruit many people who were entirely new to the project, and
              I would have liked to see less experienced reactions to it.</p>
            <h4>Overall</h4>
            <p>This project represents a strong first version of an app that
              would have great potential real world use.If this were not a school
              project I would be eager to see how it
              fared once it was released. When prioritizing user stories for the
              MVP I discarded many that I believe would ultimately make it into
              a later version of this app. I could foresee this evolving, in
              potentially with coworking spaces, and incorporating the ability
              to filter for a broader range of filters, or provide reviews on
              specific aspects of a coworking space. There are many ways this
              could develop.</p>
